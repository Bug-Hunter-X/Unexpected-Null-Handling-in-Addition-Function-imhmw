This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating an uncommon bug related to null handling in an addition function.  The function `foo` returns null if either input is null, which may not be the expected behavior in all situations. A solution is provided that handles null values more gracefully, treating them as 0. This highlights the importance of robust null checking and error handling in JavaScript functions.
